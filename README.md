## ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spanish to English word memorising app ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

While taking Spanish classes, I found it difficult to find a place to list all of the new words that I was learning. Therefore, I create an app which allowed me to store, update and revise my new vocab list.

I also wanted to practice using _WebSockets_, _Material-UI_ and _Redux_, as well as try out some new ways to structure my _React_ components.
